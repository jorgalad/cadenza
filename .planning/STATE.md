**Core value:** A notation software user can select any musical phrase, send it to Cadenza, and receive back a musically correct transformation or harmonization -- without needing to understand the theory behind it.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Frozen dataclasses for core data model (zero external deps), Pydantic only at API boundary
- Roadmap: Hand-written recursive descent OMN parser (not Lark) for better error messages
- Roadmap: REST API introduced at Phase 4 (after core + transforms + libraries), expanded incrementally
- Roadmap: MusicXML/MIDI I/O deferred to Phase 12 (not bundled with parser phase) to keep foundation focused

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (Harmonic Analysis): Key detection algorithm selection needs research during planning
- Phase 8 (Counterpoint): Constraint satisfaction approach needs research during planning
- Phase 12 (I/O Expansion): MusicXML vendor divergence between Dorico/Sibelius requires real test fixtures
